        `I was no hero. I was barely a warrior.
My years in the forests around Xer had taught me to hunt deer and bring down wolves, but the demon that burst forth from the earth’s wounds was something else entirely. It bore the fungi like a shield, its eyes burned with fire, and I felt fear freeze me in place.

I ran.
And still, it found me.

I remember the claw tearing through my chest. The ground that received me, cold and wet. The spores that sank into my blood. Everything faded to black, and I thought: This is how it ends. I die as a boy, forgotten in the forest.

But when the darkness closed in, the light came. Not warm, but hard and cold. And in that light I saw them: two serrated sabers, driven into the earth like gravestones. I reached out with a hand that already felt dead.

And when my fingers touched the steel, the voice burned into my mind.
“Rise. We are not finished yet.”

I screamed, but it was as if the scream never left me. Memories, centuries of battles, flooded into me. I saw demons fall, I heard cities burn, I felt blood on hands that were not my own.

“I am Karandras,” the voice said. “And now, so are you.”

I rose.
Not because I could, but because we could. The sabers fit in my hands, and the demon before me faltered, as if it knew the legacy better than I did. I struck. Not with my strength alone, but with ours. And in its shriek, I heard how something ancient had been reborn in my blood.

When the battle was over and the demon lay broken at my feet, I knew I would never be alone again.
I was no longer the boy from Xer.
I was Karandras.`,

        `At first, I thought the voice would only guide me in battle.
It told me where to strike, when to duck, how to let the sabers sing. I thought I could resist it once the fighting was done. I told myself it was only an echo, a memory clinging to the steel.

But soon it followed me into the quiet.

I reached to comfort a child left weeping in the streets of Xer. My hand hovered in the air — and then lowered, without my will. The voice whispered: “Let her learn fear. It will serve her better than kindness.”

I laughed once, weeks later, at a fire in the company of others. For a moment, I felt like myself again. Then I caught my reflection in the steel of my saber — eyes too cold to be mine, a smile that was not mine at all. The laughter around me died, as if they too had seen the stranger behind my face.

I dread sleep most of all.
When I dream, I no longer walk with my own steps. I stalk through forests I’ve never known, across battlefields that burned before I was born. I kill in silence, with a patience that isn’t mine. And when I wake, there are moments when I do not remember who I am.

I am still the boy from Xer.
But each day, I feel his voice growing stronger, while mine grows faint.

“You are me now,” Karandras whispers whenever I hold the sabers.
And perhaps he is right.`,

        `The boat creaked beneath us, its timbers groaning like old bones. The sea wind bit at my face, sharp and cold, and every now and then I caught myself staring at the others aboard. Adventurers, warriors, mages — people who belonged to a story already in motion.

I was not one of them.
Not yet.

I kept my hood low, my sabers hidden beneath the cloak. The steel pulsed faintly, as if impatient, as if hungry. And when the waves were quiet enough, I heard him whisper in the back of my mind.

“You will be tested again soon. The true hunt begins in Greengold.”

I clenched my jaw and tried to shut him out. I told myself I was still the boy from Xer, the one who used to hunt stags and wolves, not demons. But the others aboard gave me curious glances. Perhaps they already saw something different in me.

When the ship reached Greengold, the air changed. It wasn’t the salt of the harbor that reached us first, but the stink of rot. Spore-mist clung to the streets like a shroud, and screams echoed from deeper within the city.

Then I saw them.
Elves — their skin pale and veined with fungus, their eyes dull with corruption. They staggered toward us, once proud citizens of Greengold, now nothing but hollow husks of the spore plague.

The adventurers drew their weapons. I did too.
And the voice inside me smiled.

“Now. Let them see what you are.”

The elves lunged, claws and tendrils writhing where fingers once were. I met the first with a step to the side and felt my sabers carve through its chest. Too clean. Too practiced. It was not my move — it was his.

The others fought fiercely, spells and steel cutting down the corrupted, but I could feel the weight of eyes on me. I moved through the fray like a shadow, blades flashing in a rhythm I had never learned, yet could not forget. Each strike was precise, merciless. Each kill echoed with the cold satisfaction of the old hunter inside me.

One of the corrupted cried out in Elvish as I cut it down. For a heartbeat, I faltered — I understood its words. It begged for release.
“Finish it,” hissed Karandras. “Show them mercy in death.”

And so I did.

When the battle ended, the square before the temple was slick with blood and spores. The adventurers stood panting, their eyes drifting toward the building. From its doors seeped thick fungal growth, pulsing, spreading. The heart of the infestation.

I tightened my grip on the sabers. Their weight was steady, inevitable.
The others might have thought they had simply met another ally on their voyage to Greengold. But I knew better.

I was no longer just the boy from Xer.
I was Karandras.
And the hunt had only just begun.`,
